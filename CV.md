<h2>Research</h2>

**AITRICS Machine Learning Intern**\
August 2021 September 2022

- Developed a machine learning model with EEG data streaming at 200Hz to detect seizure at every 1 second, saving the
clients’ time of analyzing EEG signals at most 24 hours long.
- Designed 10+ experimental models using various signal processing methods and models, CNNs, GCNs, and LSTMs.
Proposed and developed a graph-based model that increased the performance by 20% for seizure classification.
- Devised a novel seizure detection evaluation method that is more intuitive and practical for healthcare applications.
- Worked jointly with clinicians to ensure the model meets clients’ needs and is practical and reliable to use in field
- Provided data visualization and model interpretation to a team of engineers, clinicians, and project managers.
- Performed preprocessing and statistical analysis of EHR and EEG data using signal processing and Fourier Transform.
- Developed SincNet + ResNet based real time arrhythmia detector to run on devices in clinics using ECG data.
Third place out of 180 teams participated (ranked by accuracy and model size).

**Data Mining Laboratory at Seoul National University, Undergraduate Research Intern** November 2020 – August 2021
- Conducted research on analyzing streaming sparse tensors in real time funded by Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea.
- Designed and developed tensor decomposition method for online data and real time inference and applied for trend
detector for high dimensional data.
- Designed a novel smoothing loss function that reduces unreliable data and tested on sparse temporal dataset.
- Conducted initial research for multi-modal recommendation model and designed graph based convolution model.
- Streamlined development process with bash automation, Linux environment and Git, and documentation.
