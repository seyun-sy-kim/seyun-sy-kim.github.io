title: Tracking Theme-change in Streaming Tensor Using AutoEncoder
layout: post

Tensor is a multi-dimensional array that can be useful in storing data with variety of features. However, as the size and dimension of a tensor grows, the harder it becomes to interpret and extract meaningful information from the noisy bulk of data. To address this issue, many researches are being done to track trend changes in tensors. This post will introduce a new attempt to captures trend changes in tensors using auto-autoencoder.
