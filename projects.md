**AI Othello**
- Wrote an AI program in C++ that can play othello against human The program uses minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening depth-first search to find the best possible move at each turn. Gained insight about how artificial intelligence plays a game

**Bouncing Ball Game (C++)**
- Wrote a program in C++ that implements a game where the player can maneuver a box, either using arrow-keys or mouse, to bounce off the ball and eliminate obstacles. Learned how to code user-interface and user-friendly program and gained deeper insight about object-oriented programming.

**Deep Learning Projects**
- In python, wrote a spiral classification program from scratch and other classification problems with various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR10,and CIFAR100 with accuracy comparable to that of state of the art.
